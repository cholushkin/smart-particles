# Smart Particles Sandbox

Welcome to the Smart Particles Sandbox, an interactive C++ project that allows users to explore particle dynamics in a customizable sandbox environment. Using the ImGui library for immediate mode graphical user interfaces and Lua for scripting through the Sol2 library, this project offers a versatile platform for simulation and visualization of particle behavior.

## Features

- **Real-time Particle Simulation**: Simulate and interact with thousands of particles in real time.
- **Immediate Mode GUI**: Built with ImGui, providing a smooth and responsive user interface.
- **Script Customization**: Customize particle properties and behavior using Lua scripts.
- **Cross-platform**: Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
